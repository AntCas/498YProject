# How to Run

1. clone the main ns3 project from https://github.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev-git

```git clone https://github.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev-git```

* Make sure that the project builds without errors
```./waf build```

* navigate to the scratch directory

```cd ~/ns-3-dev-git/scratch```

2. Place this repo inside <ns3-root>/scratch/

* Run the setup script
```./modify_ns3_files.sh```

3. Have python2, numpy, and matplotlib installed. I used gnome-open to open .png files, you may need to sub in some photo-viewer. I also used zsh's globbing syntax to find all .png files, you may need to rewrite using ```find ... -exec {} ...``` or open manually.

## Usage:

1. rebuild the project

```./waf build```

2. Run the tests

```./498Y --do_rts=[true|false]```

```../waf build```

```cd one```
```./run_one.sh```

```cd two```
```./run_two.sh```

```cd three```
```./run_three.sh```
